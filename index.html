            <h3>Unity Developer</h3>
            <p>I joined Hunted Cow Games in April 2021 as a Junior Unity Developer, but have since been promoted to Unity Developer. 
            Most of my time is spent working on an unannounced project, but I also help to maintain our other live games, Operation New Earth, and Warhammer: Chaos and Conquest.
            <br><br>All of these games are mobile live service online multiplayer games created in Unity.</p>

            <h2>Biscuit Sandwich Games</h2>
            <p>
                I was one of the founding members of Biscuit Sandwich Games, a company that was set up to develop our game Ready Set Sumo! 
                which was our winning submission for funding through the Tranzfuser compeition in 2019. During this time I gained experience leading a game development team, 
                aswell as planning and creating a game of high enough quality to release and sell.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ready Set Sumo is a multiplayer pvpve game created in Unity that put up to 4 players together in a ring to battle eachother in a quick series of rounds, while also looking out for hazards in the world.</p>

            <h2>FPS Weapon System</h2>
            <p>I created this FPS weapon system In Unity as part of a university assignment, but I took it further after graduating. 
                My goal for the system was to be able to quickly add a working gun to a game with nothing but a model and minimal setup.
                To complete this goal the system doesnt use any animations, and only requires you to select the different parts of the model, and align attachment points using unity gameobjects.
                <br><br>The system allows you to change alot of stats relating to the recoil and handling of the weapon, they can also effect the player controller that I custom made for this system, allowing you to make utilise the system to make different guns feel very unique. 
                Attachments were also implemented to allow for greater customisation of the system and weapons within it.</p>
            <p>You can find more information about the project here on my blog: <a href="https://elliotchester.blogspot.com/index.html"target="_blank"> https://elliotchester.blogspot.com/index.html</a></p>

            <h2>Seeking Arrow</h2>
            <p>After watching guardians of the galaxy 2, I decided to make a seeking arrow in an attempt to make an interactive version of the one from the movie. 
                I added it to a 3rd person controller with a gun, the arrow is able to pick a target and navigate to it without the user having to steer it. The arrow is activated when the user presses or holds a key. When the arrow is not in use it will hover by the players side ready to attack again. </p>
                <p>You can find the demo here on itch.io: <a href=" https://elliot-chester.itch.io/arrow-demo"target="_blank"> https://elliot-chester.itch.io/arrow-demo</a></p>

            <h2>Texture Transition Shader</h2>
            <p>While thinking about what I would do for my dissertation, I decided that I'd like to look into creating shaders. 
                This is my first attempt at a shader that I could use in games in the future. It allows you to transition between 2 
                textures or colours on a model. </p>
                <p>You can try the shader here on itch.io: <a href="https://elliot-chester.itch.io/texture-transition-shader"target="_blank">https://elliot-chester.itch.io/texture-transition-shader</a></p>

            <h2>C++ Projects</h2>
            <p>I have created a repository showing off some of the C++ projects that I have worked on over the past couple of years. These projects demonstrate my ability to write C++ code. 
                These projects also had me learning about AI (Pathfinding, finite state machines, behaviour trees, 
                and steering behaviours) aswell as working with OpenGL, with GLUT, GLEW, SFML and SDL. </p>
