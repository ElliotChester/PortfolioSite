            <h2>Hunted Cow</h2>
            <p>I have been working at Hunted Cow Studios since April 2021 as a Junior Unity Developer. 
                We develop mobile and PC games, including Operation New Earth and Warhammer Chaos & Conquest.</p>

            <h2>Biscuit Sandwich Games</h2>
            <p>I was one of the founding members of Biscuit Sandwich Games, a company that was set up to develop our game Ready Set Sumo! 
                which was our winning submission for Tranzfuser 2019. 
                It was in development until late 2020 when we had to cancel the project. </p>
            <p>Ready Set Sumo pits up to four players and their crazy characters against each other to 
                triumph in the ring. Battle to be the last one standing as you fight your way to victory, 
                whacking and thwacking each other with out of this world weapons.</p>

            <h2>C++ Projects</h2>
            <p>I have created a repository showing off some of the C++ projects that I have worked on over the past couple of years. These projects demonstrate my ability to write C++ code. 
                These projects also had me learning about AI (Pathfinding, finite state machines, behaviour trees, 
                and steering behaviours) aswell as working with OpenGL, with GLUT, GLEW, SFML and SDL. </p>
                <p>You can find the repository here on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ElliotChester/Portfolio">https://github.com/ElliotChester/Portfolio</a></p>

            <h2>Texture Transition Shader</h2>
            <p>While thinking about what I would do for my dissertation, I decided that I'd like to look into creating shaders. 
                This is my first attempt at a shader that I could use in games in the future. It allows you to transition between 2 
                textures or colours on a model. </p>
                <p>You can try the shader here on itch.io: <a href="https://elliot-chester.itch.io/texture-transition-shader">https://elliot-chester.itch.io/texture-transition-shader</a></p>

            <h2>Seeking Arrow</h2>
            <p>After watching guardians of the galaxy 2, I decided to make a seeking arrow in an attempt to make an interactive version of the one from the movie. 
                I added it to a 3rd person controller with a gun, the arrow is able to pick a target and navigate to it without the user having to steer it. The arrow is activated when the user presses or holds a key. When the arrow is not in use it will hover by the players side ready to attack again. </p>
