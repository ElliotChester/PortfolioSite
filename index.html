            <p>
                I was one of the founding members of Biscuit Sandwich Games, a company that was set up to develop our game Ready Set Sumo! 
                which was our winning submission for funding through the Tranzfuser compeition in 2019. During this time I gained experience leading a game development team, 
                aswell as planning and creating a game of high enough quality to release and sell.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ready Set Sumo is a multiplayer pvpve game that put up to 4 players together in a ring to battle eachother in a quick series of rounds, while also looking out for hazards in the world.</p>
