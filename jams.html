                <h2>Forget Me Not</h2>
                <p>Forget Me Not was a game I created as a team of 2, I was responsible for the programming and structure within Unity. 
                    For this jam we focused on making the game really polished, which meant great visuals, as few bugs as 
                    possible, and a complete user experience that is usually lacking in a game jam game.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can find the game to play here: <a

                <h2>Banjo</h2>
                <p>Banjo is my submission for Global Game Jam 2019, 
                    The theme for the jam was "What home means to you". 
                    We decided to make a game about a dog named Banjo, 
                    who carries his kennel around on his back. Our team was made up of a programmer, 
                    3D artist and 2D artist which is what led us to the 2.5D style that I found made the 
                    game look very visually pleasing.</p>

                <h2>Sketchbook Adventure</h2>
                <p>Sketchbook Adventure is my submission for Ludum Dare 41. 
                    The theme for this jam was "combine 2 incompatible genres". 
                    We decided to pick 2D and 3D as our genres. In the game, 
                    you play as a girl whose sketchbook has come to life. They have to collect
                     items from the 3D world in order to complete challenges in the 2D world.</p>

                <h2>Happy Ball</h2>
                <p>Happy Ball is my submission for Global Game Jam 2018. It's a first-person puzzle game where you help a ball reach its destination to unlock the next level. During this jam I wanted to make a game with a clear finish point as a lot of the games I have made in the past were endless or simply didn't have an end goal.</p>

                <h2>Energy Tank</h2>
                <p>Energy Tank is my submission for Ludum Dare 40. It's a twin-stick shooter where you collect energy orbs, the more energy orbs you collect, the faster enemies will spawn. During this jam, I wanted to focus on making the movement and controls feel smooth for both keyboard and controller users.</p>

                <h2>Duck Hunter</h2>
                <p>Duck Hunter is my submission from the 2017 Global Games Jam. This was the first game jam that I took part in. It is a tower defence game with a few different turrets and enemies. I worked alone to make this game and had a lot of fun. I put this game on the Play Store because even though I didn't plan for it to work on mobile, the game worked surprisingly well.</p>
